        <h2>Farewell.</h2>
        <p>
            It's with a heavy heart that I announce that <i>Trash Trove!'s</i> sunsetting.
            The game servers will officially go offline on <strong>the 29th of December, 2024</strong>.
        </p>
        <h3>Why's this happening?</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Trash Trove!</i> was originally made as a fun school project, built and developed by the support of you guys. Recently, <i>Trash Trove!</i> has become increasingly hard to maintain, coupled with server issues that make the experience less and less fun.<br><br>Along with the fact that <i>Trash Trove!</i> has already been submitted, presented, and graded as an assignment, I think that it's in my best interest to shut down the game rather than keep it online and not have time to update and maintain the game.
        </p>
        <h3>What Happens Next?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The servers will remain active until <strong>the 29th of December, 2024.</strong>.</li>
            <li>Top scores will be forever archived in a new <strong>Hall of Fame</strong> page.</li>
            <li>Players will retain access to any downloaded content locally on their devices.<br>(This means you can archive the game and still play it.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Thank You</h3>
        <p>
            I'm incredibly grateful for the support all of you have shown for <i>Trash Trove!</i> Your support
            and feedback have made this journey unforgettable. <br><br><strong>Thanks, everyone.</strong>
